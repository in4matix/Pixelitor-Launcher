Pixelitor Launcher for standalone Jar version.

Pixelitaor is an open source image editor by László Balázs-Csíki

https://pixelitor.sourceforge.io/

Due to the lack of documentation for the standalone Jar Version of the App, I made this very simple Ubuntu Linux launcher for anyone without the technical skills who would like to use Pixelitor 'Portable' version.

Just download the zip file, unzip it and read the instructions.
